JBoss AS 7 and EAP 6 Domain cluster configuration Setup Example.

JBoss AS7 / EAP 6 Clustering setup, Domain configuration.

This repository contains working sample of JBoss AS7 or EAP 6 configurations.
The configurations was originally developed using JBoss EAP 6.1, but later converted to JBoss EAP 6.3.
If you like to use this for JBoss AS 7 or earlier version of EAP 6, you would need to change the version number in the domain.xml, except the role based access control, which is only available in EAP 6.3.

AS 7.2 ~= EAP 6.1
AS 7.3 ~= EAP 6.2
AS 7.4 ~= EAP 6.3
